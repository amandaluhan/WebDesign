      Hey! I'm Amanda Han. And this is the result you get from me designing and coding a website for the first time ever. Exciting stuff.
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm currently a freshman studying at Rhode Island School of Design in the tiny city of Providence. My intended major is Industrial Design. The best way I've heard Industrial Design explained is by a fellow RISD classmate, and it goes: if you were to take your house, turn it upside-down and shake it, everything that falls out that isn't alive is Industrial Design. 
      <br>
      <br>
      My hometown is sunny California. I grew up in the Bay Area and have lived there all my life up until now. I can tell you California is really one of the best places to be. I love being on the east coast for college but I mean, you really can't top year-round amazing weather. And beachy coasts. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Besides doing art, I'd say my biggest thing is dance. I've tried quite the variety of other extra-curriculer activities when I was younger - my mom has thrown me into soccer practices and swim tryouts, I've figure skated and played the piano, but nothing really stuck with me like dance did. I am currently on IMPLUSE Dance Company, a hip hop dance company founded and run by students of Brown University and RISD.
      <br>
      <br>
      My vision for myself as a designer is to collaborate aspects of artistry, innovation, and technology in future projects.
